# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

AXI (Agent eXperience Interface) defines 10 ergonomic principles for building CLI tools that AI agents use via shell execution. This repo contains:

- **`packages/axi-sdk-js/`** — Shared Node.js SDK every `*-axi` CLI builds on. `runAxiCli()` provides built-in commands for all tools: `--help`, `-v`/`--version`, and `update` (self-update). `update` is a reserved command name; a tool may shadow it by registering its own handler.
- **`bench-github/`** — Benchmark harness that compares gh-axi vs gh CLI vs GitHub MCP across 17 agent tasks, graded by an LLM judge.
- **`bench-browser/`** — Benchmark harness that compares browser automation tools (agent-browser, pinchtab, chrome-devtools-mcp) across 16 browsing tasks.
- **`.agents/skills/axi/SKILL.md`** — The AXI skill definition (installable via `npx skills add kunchenguid/axi`).
- **`docs/`** — Static website (axi.md).

The reference AXI implementation (`gh-axi`) lives in a separate repo: [kunchenguid/gh-axi](https://github.com/kunchenguid/gh-axi).

## Development Commands

### Benchmark harness (GitHub)

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --dir bench-github run bench -- run --condition axi --task merged_pr_ci_audit --repeat 5 --agent claude
pnpm --dir bench-github run bench -- matrix --repeat 5 --agent claude
pnpm --dir bench-github run bench -- report
pnpm --dir bench-github test           # Run bench tests (vitest)
```

### Benchmark harness (Browser)

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm --dir bench-browser run bench -- run --condition agent-browser --task read_static_page --repeat 5
pnpm --dir bench-browser run bench -- matrix --repeat 5    # full run: all conditions × all tasks × 5 repeats
pnpm --dir bench-browser run bench -- report
pnpm --dir bench-browser test           # Run bench tests (vitest)
```

### Social video rendering

```sh
pnpm --dir bench-browser run render:social   # Render social/index.html via HyperFrames to docs/social/rendered/race.mp4
```

The source composition is `bench-browser/social/` (a HyperFrames project). Edit `social/index.html` for content/animation; see `social/DESIGN.md` for the visual identity. Use the `/hyperframes` skill when modifying the composition.

Requires Node.js >= 20 and `gh` CLI installed and authenticated.

## Architecture

### Benchmark (GitHub)

`bench-github/src/runner.ts` orchestrates runs: clones a test repo, writes condition-specific AGENTS.md, invokes the agent (codex or claude), parses JSONL usage, and runs the LLM grader. Conditions are defined in `bench-github/config/conditions.yaml`, tasks in `bench-github/config/tasks.yaml`. Results go to `bench-github/results/`, published results in `bench-github/published-results/`.

### Benchmark (Browser)

`bench-browser/src/runner.ts` orchestrates browser benchmark runs: creates a workspace with condition-specific CLAUDE.md, manages browser daemon lifecycle, invokes Claude with `--bare` isolation, parses JSONL usage, and grades results. Conditions are defined in `bench-browser/config/conditions.yaml`, tasks in `bench-browser/config/tasks.yaml`.

## Releasing `axi-sdk-js`

`axi-sdk-js` versions and publishes to npm through [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please); there is no manual `npm version` or `npm publish` step.

How it works:

1. Land a conventional-commit change on `main` that touches `packages/axi-sdk-js/**`; under the current pre-1.0 config in `release-please-config.json`, `feat:` and `fix:` commits both bump patch versions (for example `0.1.7` -> `0.1.8`), while breaking changes bump minor versions.
2. The `axi-sdk-js-release-please` workflow opens or updates a release PR titled `chore(main): release axi-sdk-js <version>`.
   That PR is the only place the version in `packages/axi-sdk-js/package.json` may change, and the only place `packages/axi-sdk-js/CHANGELOG.md` and `.release-please-manifest.json` may change.
   Never hand-edit those files; the `Guard generated files` check specifically fails PRs that modify the generated changelog or manifest outside release-please.
3. **Publishing is a maintainer action: merge the open release-please PR.**
   That merge creates the git tag and GitHub release, after which the same workflow runs `format:check`, `lint`, `build`, `test`, then `npm publish --access public --provenance` (OIDC provenance via `id-token: write`, no static npm token in the repo).
4. Verify with `npm view axi-sdk-js version` and confirm the published `dist/` carries the new code (for example `npm pack axi-sdk-js@<version>` then grep the extracted `dist/`).

Because the release PR carries the version bump, a downstream `*-axi` tool only needs to bump its `axi-sdk-js` dependency to inherit new SDK built-ins (such as the reserved `update` command) - no code change in the tool.

## Conventions

- Packages use ES modules (`"type": "module"`) with TypeScript targeting ES2022/Node16.
- Tests are colocated in `test/` directories mirroring `src/` structure and use vitest.
